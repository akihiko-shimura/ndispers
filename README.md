# ndispers
Ndispers is a Python package for calculating refractive index dispersion of various media such as crystals and glasses.
It allows you to easily calculate refractive index and its derivative quantities, such as group velocity and group velocity dispersion, group index, third-order dispersion, as a function of wavelength, polar and azimuth angles with respect to dielectric principal axes of anisotropic crystals.
Since this package provide those functions with the methods of an medium object, these calculations can be implemented to other numerical simulations in nonlinear and ultrafast optics.
